[size=200][b]VASSAL {{version}} Released[/b][/size]

The VASSAL Team is happy to announce the release of VASSAL {{version}}.

[size=150][b]IMPORTANT[/b][/size]

* Things may be broken which worked previously. If you find a new bug, please report it.

* If you save a module in VASSAL 3.4, you will NOT be able to open it afterwards with VASSAL 3.3 or earlier. We recommend keeping a backup copy of any pre-3.4 modules you plan to modify in 3.4 until you've verified that everything works to your satisfaction.

* Some modules containing custom drawing code may render incorrectly on HiDPI displays, starting with 3.3. If you are the maintainer of such a module, let us know and we can advise you about what needs updating for 3.4 in your code.

[size=150][b]Minimum Requirements[/b][/size]

VASSAL 3.4 requires Java 11 or later.

The Windows and Mac packages have an appropriate version of Java bundled with them, so there is no need to install Java separately on those operating systems. On Linux, use your package manager to install Java 11 or later.

[size=159][b]Help us test[/b][/size]

Should you find any problems/oddities/bugs, please tell us so that we can fix them for a future release of VASSAL.

Please report bugs in the Technical Support & Bugs category at the [url=http://vassalengine.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=3]VASSAL forums[/url].


Cheers,

The VASSAL Team
