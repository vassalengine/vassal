* Things may be broken which worked previously. If you find a new bug, please report it.

* Modules saved in {{version_feature}} are not openable by earlier versions of VASSAL. We recommend keeping a backup copy of any pre-{{version_feature}} modules you plan to modify in {{version_feature}} until you've verified that everything works to your satisfaction.

* Some modules containing custom drawing code may render incorrectly on HiDPI displays, starting with 3.3. If you are the maintainer of such a module, let us know and we can advise you about what needs updating in your code.
