            <td valign="top">This trait allows you to specify an arbitrary shape for a Game Piece, so that the piece will only be selected
            when its image is clicked on precisely, rather than being selected whenever the player clicks anywhere inside its "bounding box".<br>
            <br>
The shape of a piece is used to determine where the player must click
to drag a piece or bring up its popup menu.&nbsp; It also is used to
highlight the outline of the piece when it has been selected. Ordinarily
a <i>bounding box</i> around the maximum rectangular limits of the image
        provides the shape for both the piece's selection boundaries and
        its highlight outline. <br>
            <br>
By using transparency in your image, you can make your piece
be drawn with any shape.&nbsp; However, without the Non-Rectangular
trait, the piece can be selected even by clicking on the transparent
portions of the image, which can lead to confusion.&nbsp; The
Non-Rectangular trait allows you to specify the shape of the
piece to be identical to the non-transparent portion of an image.&nbsp;
Simply select the appropriate image from the drop-down list.<br>
        <br>
For the most common case, a piece with a simple image that has some transparent portions, and that transparency is contained in the
image file as "a transparent color", simply provide the same image again to the Non-Rectangular trait, and this will remove the
        transparent portions of the piece from the selectable part of the piece.
        <br>
        <br>
In the example shown at right, the file <i>test.png</i> has some orange regions representing the visible parts of a piece, and transparent
areas in which nothing will be drawn. At the left, the <i>mask</i> is shown -- the black portions representing areas which can be clicked on
        to select the piece, and the white areas representing transparent regions, clicking on which will not select the piece. This helps verify that the mask is being read properly.
