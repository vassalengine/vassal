   * Setting a persistent property writes a property value into the piece (creating a new entry in the piece's persistent
   * property table if the specified key does not yet exist in it). Persistent properties are game-state-robust: they are
   * saved/restored with saved games, and are passed via {@link Command} to other players' clients in a multiplayer game.
   * The persistent property value can then be read from the piece via e.g. #getProperty. When reading back properties
   * out of a piece, the piece's built-in properties are checked first, then scratchpad properties (see #setProperty),
   * then external properties such as Global Properties. If <i>only</i> persistentProperties are to be searched, use
   * {@link #getPersistentProperty} instead.
   *
   * <br><br>In practical terms, setPersistentProperty is used mainly to implement the "Old" properties of BasicPiece (e.g.
   * "OldLocationName", "OldZone", "OldMap", "OldBoard", "OldX", "OldY"). A Persistent Property is indeed nearly identical
   * with DynamicProperty in storage/retrieval characteristics, and simply lacks the in-module interface for setting
   * values, etc. Module Designers are thus recommended to stick with Dynamic Property traits for these functions.
   *
   * @param key String key naming the persistent property to be set. If a corresponding persistent property does not exist it will be created.
   * @param val New value for the persistent property
   * @return a {@link Command} object which, when passed to another player's client via logfile, server, or saved game, will allow the
   * result of the "set" operation to be replicated.
