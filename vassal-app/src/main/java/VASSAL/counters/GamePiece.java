/**
 * Interface to deal with the behaviors of a physical component of the game, <b><i>or a Trait of one</i></b>. Although from
 * the name you might think that anything implementing this would be "a whole piece" (and perhaps in Elder Times that was true),
 * a GamePiece is in fact implemented <b>NOT ONLY</b> by all of the three "basic" piece types: {@link BasicPiece}, {@link Stack},
 * or {@link Deck}; <b>BUT ALSO</b> it is implemented by all of the Traits ({@link Decorator} classes) that form the subcomponents
 * of a full "piece" as we would know it on the game board.
 *
 * <br><br>When a GamePiece method of a Trait (Decorator) is called, the Trait first attempts to service the method call, and then
 * normally (though not always, as in the case of "draw" calls to pieces with Invisible/{@link Hideable} or Mask/{@link Obscurable}
 * traits) calls the same method for the next trait inward from it in the Decorator stack for the overall piece, and so on in turn
 * until the "innermost" piece (normally a {@link BasicPiece}) has its method called.
 *
 * <br><b>Methods:</b>
 * <br>{@link #getType} - gets type information fixed throughout game
 * <br>{@link #getState} - gets state information changeable during gameplay
 * <br>{@link #setState} - sets state information changeable during gameplay
 * <br>{@link #setProperty} - sets other properties, *possibly* game-related, about a piece.
 * <br>{@link #getProperty} - gets other properties, *possibly* game-related, about a piece.
 * <br>
 * <br>{@link #draw} - tells this piece or part-of-piece to draw itself
 * <br>{@link #keyEvent} - gives this piece or Trait a chance to process key events. This is the main way for a GamePiece to receive "events".
 * <br>
 * <br>{@link #getName} - the plain English name of the piece
 * <br>{@link #getLocalizedName()} - the localized name of the piece
 * <br>{@link #getMap} and {@link #setMap} - Each GamePiece belongs to a single {@link Map}
 * <br>{@link #getPosition} and {@link #setPosition} - position on the map
 * <br>{@link #getParent} and {@link #setParent} - deals with membership in a {@link Stack}
 * <br>{@link #boundingBox} - bounding box
 * <br>{@link #getShape} - shape
 * <br>{@link #getId} and {@link #setId} - each piece has a unique ID
 * <br>
 * <br><b>See Also:</b>
 * <br><i>extends</i> {@link PropertySource}
 * <br><i>extended by </i> {@link EditablePiece}, {@link VASSAL.i18n.TranslatablePiece}
