Provides classes for building Java instances automatically from XML
files.  This is a home-grown XML-Java binding used to build a {@link
VASSAL.build.GameModule} from the module file.  Every XML element in
the buildFile corresponds to the name of a class in the
<code>build</code> package hierarchy.  If a class can contain other 
{@link VASSAL.build.Buildable} instances as sub-components, those
sub-component classes will be contained in a corresponding package.  For
example, the <code>VASSAL.build.module.map</code> package contains
classes that are valid sub-components of the {@link VASSAL.build.module.Map} class.
