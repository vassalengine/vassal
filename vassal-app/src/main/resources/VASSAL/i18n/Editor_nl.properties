# Module Editor Properties
# Contains all translatable strings for the Module Editor
# Strings for the playable user interface are in VASSAL.properties
#
# NOTE: Comments to the translator to provide context can be provided
#       on a # comment line preceding the translation key
#       Translator comments should be provided where possible,
#       especially for short or single word strings.
#
# =============================  NOTE  =============================
# THIS FILE CAN ONLY CONTAIN KEYS THAT COMMENCE WITH Editor.
# Any other keys MUST be recorded in the VASSAL.properties bundle.
#
# Keys that are used in the Editor only should have an Editor.
# prefix and be defined here.
#
# Keys that are shared between the Player and the Editor (and MM)
# should be defined ONCE in VASSAL.properties with a key that
# does NOT commence with Editor.
#
# Resources.getString selects the correct bundle to look up based
# on the key.
# =============================  NOTE  =============================
#
# FIXME Remove any ":  " from the ends of Strings. Configurers will be modified to add them if needed.
