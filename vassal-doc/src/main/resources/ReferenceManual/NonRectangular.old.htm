    <td valign="top">This trait allows you to specify an arbitrary shape for a Game Piece, so that the piece will only
    be selected when its image is clicked on precisely, rather than being selected whenever the player clicks anywhere
    inside its "bounding box".<br>
    <br>
    The shape of a piece is used to determine where the player must click to drag a piece or bring up its popup menu. It
    also is used to highlight the outline of the piece when it has been selected. Ordinarily a <i>bounding box</i>
    around the maximum rectangular limits of the image provides the shape for both the piece's selection boundaries and
    its highlight outline. .<br>
    <br>
    By using transparency in your image, you can arrange for your piece be <i>drawn</i> with any shape. However, without
    the Non-Rectangular trait, the piece can be selected even by clicking on the transparent portions of the image,
    which can lead to confusion. The Non-Rectangular trait allows you to specify the shape of the piece to be identical
    to the non-transparent portion of an image. Simply select the appropriate image from the drop-down list.<br>
    <br>
    <b>NOTE:</b> For the most common case, a piece with a simple image that has some transparent portions, and that
    transparency is contained in the image file as "a transparent color", simply provide the same image again to the
    Non-Rectangular trait, and this will remove the transparent portions of the piece from the selectable part of the
    piece.<br>
    <br>
    <b>EXAMPLE:</b> In the example shown at right, the file <i>test.png</i> has some orange regions representing the visible parts of a
    piece, and transparent areas in which nothing will be drawn. At the left, the <i>mask</i> is shown -- the black
    portions representing areas which can be clicked on to select the piece, and the white areas representing
    transparent regions, clicking on which will not select the piece. This helps verify that the mask is being read
    properly.<br>
