    <tr>
    <td valign="top">Pieces with this trait will leave behind a graphic trail showing the positions through which the
    piece has been moved. The trail consists of a circle for each past location, connected by straight lines. <br><br>
    If it is desirable for players to be able to clear this movement history during play, then the piece should also
    contain a <a href="MarkMoved.htm">Mark When Moved</a> trait. The movement trail will be reset whenever the <i>Moved</i>
    property of the <i>Mark When Moved</i> trait is cleared.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Key Command:</b>&nbsp; A keyboard shortcut or <a href="NamedKeyCommand.htm">Named Key Command</a> to show/hide
    the movement trail. Toggles the trail on and off. If left blank, the trail is always visible.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Menu Command:</b>&nbsp; The right-click context menu command to show/hide the movement trail.&nbsp; If left
    blank, no context menu entry appears, although the key command may still be used.<br>
    <br>
    <b>TURN ON Key Command:</b>&nbsp; A key command or <a href="NamedKeyCommand.htm">Named Key Command</a> to turn the
    movement trail display on. Unlike the main Key Command which toggles the trail state, this one always turns the
    trails on (shows them). It can be useful for e.g. implementing a Toolbar button to show trails for all pieces.<br>
    <br>
    <b>TURN OFF Key Command:</b>&nbsp; A key command or <a href="NamedKeyCommand.htm">Named Key Command</a> to turn the
    movement trail display off. Unlike the main Key Command which toggles the trail state, this one always hides the
    trails. It can be useful for e.g. implementing a Toolbar button to show trails for all pieces.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CLEAR TRAIL Key Command:</b>&nbsp; A key command or <a href="NamedKeyCommand.htm">Named Key Command</a> to clear
    the movement history for this piece. This erases any existing trails, but leaves the trail's <i>showing</i> or <i>
    hidden</i> state alone -- so a piece with trails showing that has its movement history cleared will simply resume
    showing new trails the next time it is moved.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Trails start visible:</b>&nbsp; If checked, the piece will begin the game displaying movement trails.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Trails visible to all players:</b>&nbsp; If selected, then toggling the visibility of the trail will affect all
    players' views and will be saved along with the game.&nbsp; Otherwise, each player controls the visibility of trails
    on that player's view.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Circle Radius:&nbsp;</b>The radius in pixels of the circle representing each location in the trail.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Circle fill color:&nbsp;</b>The color of the location circles.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Line Color:&nbsp;</b>The color of the connecting lines.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Line Thickness:&nbsp;</b>The thickness in pixels of the connecting lines.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Selected transparency:</b>&nbsp; The transparency of the trail when the piece is selected.&nbsp; 0 is
    transparent; 100 is opaque.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Unselected transparency:</b>&nbsp; The transparency of the trail when the piece is not selected.&nbsp; 0 is
    transparent; 100 is opaque.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Display points off-map:</b>&nbsp; If the map has buffer space surrounding the boards, the trail circles will be
    drawn within this distance from the board edges.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Display trails off-map:</b>&nbsp; If the map has buffer space surrounding the boards, the trail lines will be
    drawn within this distance from the board edges.<br>
