== Overview

VASSAL is a general-purpose engine for building online versions of traditional turn-based games. To play a game using VASSAL, you must first have a module for that game. Many modules are available for download on the http://www.vassalengine.org/community/index.php?option=com_vassal_modules&task=displayAll[VASSAL Modules page], although a module need not be hosted on the web site to be playable.

== Quick Start

For an overview of VASSAL's capabilities, select Help->Take the Tour, and step through the tour by hitting the image:images/StepForward.png[image] Step Forward button.

To play a game, download a VASSAL module file to your computer. Select File->Open Module and choose the downloaded module. This will open a controls window for the game. Start a new game or load a saved game by using the File menu of the controls window. Some modules come with optional extensions, which can be downloaded separately. To enable an extension, right-click (Mac users: Command-click) on the module in the Module Library window, choose Add Extension and select the downloaded extension. +

You can also specify any number of directories containing saved games and load those games directly from the Module Library window. +
 +
From the Module Library's File menu, you can edit any module or extension, or create new ones from scratch. You can also import modules created by Aide de Camp 2 (support for other formats is planned for the future). +
 +
Select Tools->Server Status to see what games are being played on the live server. To connect to the server, load a module and hit the image:images/connect.gif[connect] Connect button. To chat with other players, double-click on the room with those players. To begin playing, one player must start a game from the File menu. The other player right-clicks on the first player's name in the server controls and selects Synchronize. +
 +
VASSAL supports languages other than English. To change your preferred language, open any module, choose File->Preferences and select your language from the drop-down menu in the General tab. If your language is not listed, you can help provide a translation by selecting Tools->Translate VASSAL User Interface. Further details are given link:ReferenceManual/Translations.htm[here].
