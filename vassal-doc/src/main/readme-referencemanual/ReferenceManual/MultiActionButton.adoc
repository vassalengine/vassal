=== Multi-Action Button

The Multi-Action Button combines buttons from the Toolbar into a single button.
The named would-be buttons are removed from the Toolbar and a new button is added.
Clicking this button automatically invokes the actions of all the removed & combined "buttons". +

*EXAMPLE:*  A <<GlobalKeyCommand.adoc#top,Global Key Command>> is defined that resets the fatigue level of all armies on the map.
A second Global Key Command returns them to their home base.
A Multi-Action Button can be used to combine both actions into a single Toolbar button.

*EXAMPLE:*  A <<GameModule.adoc#DiceButton,Dice Button>> is defined that exposes its result as a property named _Damage_.
Some Game Pieces are defined with a <<TriggerAction.adoc#top,Trigger Action>> trait that compares the level of a <<Layer.adoc#top,Layer>> (representing armor) with the _Damage_ property and deletes the piece if the level is below the _Damage_ value.
A <<GlobalKeyCommand.adoc#top,Global Key Command>> invokes the Trigger Action.
A Multi-Action Button is defined that invokes the Dice Button followed by the Global Key Command, resulting in the automatic deletion of any units with armor less than the random amount of damage.
