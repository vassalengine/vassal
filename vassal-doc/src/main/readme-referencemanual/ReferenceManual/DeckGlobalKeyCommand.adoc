=== Deck Global Key Command

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|===
|This <<Deck.adoc#top,Deck>> Sub-Component adds an action that applies a key command to to pieces contained within the Deck, similar to the <<Map.adoc#GlobalKeyCommand,Global Key Command>> component of a Map Window or of a Game Piece.

To add a Deck Global Key Command to one of your Decks, use the Editor's configuration window to navigate to the _[Deck]_ entry for the Deck you want to add it to.
Right-click on the _[Deck]_ entry and select _Add Deck Global Key Command_.

*Menu Command:* Text for an entry in the Deck's right-click context menu that will activate the Deck Global Key Command.

*Global Command:*  The <<NamedKeyCommand.adoc#top,Key Command or Named Key Command>> that will be applied to the pieces in the Deck.

*Matching Properties:*  The key command will only be applied to pieces which match the specified <<PropertyMatchExpression.adoc#top,Property Match Expression>>. If you do not enter a property expression, then all pieces in the Deck can receive the key command, subject to the _Affects_ field, below.

*Affects:*  The Deck Global Key Command can apply to all pieces which match the expression, or to a set number only (always counting from the top of the Deck). Use a setting of 1 to select the top piece.

*Report Format:*  A <<MessageFormat.adoc#top,Message Format>> that is echoed to the chat log whenever the Deck Global Key Command is activated.
