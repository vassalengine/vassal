=== Properties

A Property is like a variable in programming: it has a _value_ which can be referenced by including its _name_ in <<Expression.adoc#top,Expressions>>, <<MessageFormat.adoc#top,Message Formats>> and other similar fields.
Most types of Property have their values change through the course of the game.
Some Properties can have their values set by commands provided in Game Pieces themselves; others have their values set by the system and cannot be changed from within the module.

Each Game Piece has its own set of properties (each with a name and a value) that can be used for identification by various components.
You can add your own new properties to a Game Piece _explicitly_ by adding <<DynamicProperty.adoc#top,Dynamic Property>> traits to create values which can be changed during the course of the game and <<PropertyMarker.adoc#top,Marker>> traits for properties whose values will remain constant.
System-defined properties are also added _implicitly_ when other traits are added (see below). <<GlobalProperties.adoc#top,Global Properties>> can also be defined for a Zone, a Map or for the entire module.
If a referenced Property name is not defined in a Game Piece, the VASSAL looks for the value in the Zone containing the piece, then in the Map containing the piece, then in the module.

Properties can be matched using <<Expression.adoc#top,Expressions>> like _name == value_ for an exact match, _name != value_ for a non-match, or _name =~ value_ for a https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html[regular expression] match.
For properties that return a numeric value (e.g.
the level in a <<Layer.adoc#Properties,Layer)>> you can use _<_, _\<=_, _>_, and _>=._  You can combine expressions using && for logical AND and || for a logical OR.

NOTE: Properties associated with specific traits (e.g. Obscured) have a value of true or false if that trait exists in the piece, but will have a value of "" if that trait does not exist. So when using these traits in expression, you should always test if the value is true, or not true, never test for false: +
`{property == true}` +
`{property != true}` +
Do not use +
`{! property}` +
in cases like these as this will generate an error if the property does not have a value.



*Components that use properties*

* Any <<MessageFormat.adoc#top,Message Format>> defined in a Game Piece will substitute values for the properties defined on that Game Piece.

* The <<Map.adoc#GlobalKeyCommand,Global Key Command>> component uses properties to determine which pieces will respond to the command.
* The <<Map.adoc#GamePieceLayers,Game Piece Layers>> component uses properties to determine relative ordering when drawing pieces on the map.
* The <<TriggerAction.adoc#top,Trigger Action>> trait uses properties to determine when to fire a Key Command or <<NamedKeyCommand.adoc#top,Named Key Command>> .
* The <<Label.adoc#top,Text Label>> trait substitutes properties when setting the text of the label.
* A <<ZonedGrid.adoc#Zone,Zone>> uses properties to specify a <<ZonedGrid.adoc#ZoneHighlighter,Zone Highlighter>>.

*Properties defined by other components*

* The <<GlobalProperties.adoc#top,Global Property>> component defines properties for a <<ZonedGrid.adoc#Zone,Zone>>, <<Map.adoc#top,Map>> or the <<GameModule.adoc#top,module>>.
* The <<GlobalOptions.adoc#top,Global Options>> component allows you to tie property values to preferences settings.
* The results of a roll by a <<GameModule.adoc#DiceButton,Dice Button>> is exposed as a property
* A <<Deck.adoc#top,Deck>> component exposes the number of cards remaining as a Map-level property.
