=== Can Rotate

This trait allows a piece to be rotated through an arbitrary number of facings.
You can choose the number of valid facings.
For example, a hex-based game may have 6 (or possibly 12) possible facings, while a game with a square grid game might have 4 or 8.

Alternatively, you can allow any arbitrary facing.
In this case, selecting the _Rotate_ command will change the cursor and let the user drag the cursor to select the facing of the piece interactively.

An optional additional command will rotate the piece to a random facing (in one of the valid facings, if applicable).

NOTE:  The _Can Rotate_ trait will rotate only those traits that _appear above it_ in the list of traits for a Game Piece.
Traits below the "Can Rotate" trait will be drawn on top of the rotated image.

NOTE:  Since the rotations are created on the fly from a bitmapped image, the image quality of a rotated counter may be lower than the unrotated version.
Alternatively, you may get better image quality for your rotations by creating separate images for each rotation in an external paint program (If your images are based on vector objects, you can rotate them without degrading quality) and putting them into different levels of a <<Layer.adoc#top,Layer>>.

NOTE: It is advisable to avoid including spaces or other special characters in this field.

*Allow arbitrary rotations:*::  Check the box to enable arbitrary rotation instead of rotation through a fixed number of facings.

*Number of allowed facings:*::  Number of facings if fixed facings selected.

*Rotate clockwise:*:: The Menu text and <<NamedKeyCommand.adoc#top,Keystroke or Named Command>> to rotate clockwise through fixed facings if fixed facings selected.

*Rotate counter clockwise:*:: The Menu text and <<NamedKeyCommand.adoc#top,Keystroke or Named Command>> to rotate counter clockwise through fixed facings if fixed facings selected.

*Rotate randomly:*:: The Menu text and <<NamedKeyCommand.adoc#top,Keystroke or Named Command>> to select a random rotation.

[#RotatorProperties]
==== Properties

A Can Rotate trait defines a number of <<Properties.adoc#top,Properties>>.  In the name of the properties, <Rotator_name> is the _Rotator Name_ specified in the trait configuration.

* _<Rotator_name>_Facing_ returns the current facing if the number of facings is fixed. The value is an integer that ranges from 1 (the original, un-rotated state) to the the number of allowed facings. For example, if the number of facings is 4, then this property returns a value from 1 to 4.
* _<Rotator_name>_Degrees_ returns the current rotation angle if arbitrary rotations are allowed.
