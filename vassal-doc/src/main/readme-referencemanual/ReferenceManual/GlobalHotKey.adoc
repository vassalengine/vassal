=== Global Hotkey

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|===
|This trait adds an action that invokes a Hotkey, i.e., a keyboard shortcut or <<NamedKeyCommand.adoc#top,Named Key Command>> for a Toolbar button in the Module window or a Map Window.
Essentially it allows a piece to activate a function from the Toolbar.

*Menu Text:*  Right-click context menu text.
If left blank, no context menu item will appear.

*Key Command:*  A Key Command or <<NamedKeyCommand.adoc#top,Named Key Command>> to initiate the action.

*Global Hotkey:*  The Hotkey that will be applied to the Toolbar -- in other words the Hotkey assigned to the Toolbar button you wish to activate.

*EXAMPLE:*  A Dice Button component has been added to the Toolbar and assigned the Hotkey F2.
A Game Piece is given a Global Hotkey trait with Menu text _Roll Dice,_ Keyboard Command _CTRL+R_ and Global Hotkey _F2_.
Now, selecting the piece and typing _CTRL+R_ or selecting _Roll Dice_ from the right-click context menu will roll the dice button just as if the player had clicked the button in the Toolbar or typed _F2_ from the keyboard.

When _Ctrl+H_ pressed, send _F2_ to the Toolbar
