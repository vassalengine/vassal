=== General

VASSAL's Module Editor can be used to create new modules, modify existing ones, and add extensions to them.
When you open a module for Edit (or select the "New Module" option), you will be presented with a Configuration Window showing the module's <<GameModule.adoc#top,Components>>.

The Configuration Window is used to edit either a <<GameModule.adoc#top,Module>> or a <<Extension.adoc#top,Module Extension>>. The menu bar of the Configuration Window offers the following actions:

* *File*: Save the module or save it to a different file.
* *Help*: This reference manual.
* *Updaters*: Create a <<ModuleUpdater.adoc#top,Module updater>> or <<SavedGameUpdater.adoc#top,update saved games>>
* *Translate:* Help <<Translations.adoc#top,translate>> VASSAL into another language<<SavedGameUpdater.adoc#top>>

Use the _Cut_, _Copy_, _Paste_, and _Move_ commands to move Components around within the module, and use the _Search_ command from the _Edit_ menu if you need to find one.

===== Properties

Brings up a dialog in which you specify the options for that components.
Double-clicking on a component also brings up its Properties dialog.

===== Search

This option from the Edit menu lets you search for Components by name or by class name (the class name pf a Component is the "type" of Component it is, enclosed in square braces in the Editor's Configuration Window, such as a "Map Window").

===== Delete

===== Clone

Makes an exact copy of the component and inserts it after the existing component.
