In addition to standard <<Properties.adoc#top,Properties>>, you can include $countPieces$ to count the pieces included in the display. You can also include a property with the name _sum(propertyName)_ where _propertyName_ is a property defined on a Game Piece.
The sum of the numeric values of this property for all included pieces will be substituted. **Note:** If you are using a Beanshell expression here instead of just substitution with $..$ then for _sum_ you will need to use _sumProperties_ as Beanshell has its own separate sum keyword as documented in <<Expressions.adoc#top, Expressions>>.
