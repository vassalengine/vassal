*Border/text color:*::  Color of any text drawn and the border around the overall viewer.

*Display when at least this many pieces will be included:*::  If set to 0, then the viewer will display even if the location is empty.
Otherwise, it will display only if 1 or 2 pieces have been included via the settings below.

*Always display when zoom level is less than:* :: Regardless of the above "at least this many" setting, the viewer will also display when the map's magnification factor is less than this number.

*Draw pieces:*::  If selected, then the included pieces will be drawn in the viewer.

*Center text over pieces:*:: When selected, the text displayed above each piece will be centered over the piece, otherwise it will be left-justified.

*Stretch summary text box to width of pieces:*:: Stretch the size of the summary text piece to be the same with as the display of pieces, even if it would normally be narrower.

*Additional offset upward (summary text):*:: The number of pixels to adjust the summary text box upwards from its usual position. Use negative numbers to adjust it down.

*Font size:*:: Fort size for the text drawn by the stack viewer.

*Summary text above pieces:*::  A <<MessageFormat.adoc#top,Message Format>> specifying the text to display above the drawn pieces in the viewer.
In addition to standard <<Properties.adoc#top,Properties>>, you can include $countPieces$ to count the pieces included in the display. You can also include a property with the name _sum(propertyName)_ where _propertyName_ is a property defined on a Game Piece.
The sum of the numeric values of this property for all included pieces will be substituted.

*Text below each piece:*::  A <<MessageFormat.adoc#top,Message Format>> specifying the text to display below each included piece.

*Text for empty location:*::  A <<MessageFormat.adoc#top,Message Format>> specifying the text to display when no pieces have been selected.

*Include individual pieces:*::  Specifies how pieces are to be selected for inclusion in the viewer.
You may restrict the pieces according to the <<GamePieceLayers.adoc#top,Game Piece Layer>> to which they belong.
Alternatively, you may specify a <<PropertyMatchExpression.adoc#top,Property Match Expression>> to match desired values of one or more <<Properties.adoc#top,Properties>> in order for a piece to be included. You can also combine use of a property match expression with the option to display pieces from only the topmost layer (the other layer options can all be duplicated within a property match expression).

*Include non-stacking pieces:*::  If selected, then pieces with a <<NonStacking.adoc#top,Does not stack>> trait specifying the piece does not Stack are eligible for inclusion in the viewer.
Otherwise, they are excluded regardless of any other filters.

*Include move-when-selected pieces:*::  If selected, then pieces with a <<NonStacking.adoc#top,Does not stack>> trait specifying the piece may only move when selected are eligible for inclusion in the viewer.
Otherwise, they are excluded regardless of any other filters.

*Include non-movable pieces:*::  If selected, then pieces with a <<NonStacking.adoc#top,Does not stack>> trait specifying the piece may not move are eligible for inclusion in the viewer.
Otherwise, they are excluded regardless of any other filters.
