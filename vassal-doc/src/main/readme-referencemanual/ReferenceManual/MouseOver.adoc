=== Mouse-over Stack Viewer
A Mouseover Stack Viewer displays a "rollover" or "tooltip" for a stack when the mouse cursor is moved over it, after a specified delay. The tooltip can be configured to include images and/or display descriptive text about the pieces in the stack. Note that a "stack" for this purpose can consist of a single piece or multiple pieces, or even a deck.

Occasionally pieces will want to "draw themselves differently" inside of a Mouseover Stack Viewer. For this purpose they can check the property `DrawingMouseover` in e.g. a Calculated Property or a Label's "Follows Expression Value" field. Alternatively the property `DrawingMouseoverIndex` will contain 2 while drawing the mouseover, 1 otherwise; this can be useful as an index for a Follows Expression layer because it avoids the substantial performance cost of a full Beanshell expression e.g. `{ DrawingMouseover ? 2 : 1 }`.

If a Map contains multiple Mouse-over Stack Viewers, they will be processed in order from the top until one of them causes a rollover to be drawn, after which no further rollovers will be drawn. If you change the order of the Mouseover-stack Viewers, you will need to restart VASSAL before the ordering change will take effect.

*Description:*:: A brief description of this component for your reference.

*Recommended Delay before display (ms):*::  When the mouse has been stationary for this many milliseconds, the viewer will appear.
This can be overridden in the preferences.

*Keyboard shortcut to display:*::  Players may display the viewer without waiting by pressing this shortcut key.
This can be disabled in the preferences.

*Background color:*::  Pieces/text are drawn against a background of this color.

*Border/text color:*::  Color of any text drawn and the border around the overall viewer.

*Display when at least this many pieces will be included:*::  If set to 0, then the viewer will display even if the location is empty.
Otherwise, it will display only if 1 or 2 pieces have been included via the settings below.

*Always display when zoom level is less than:* :: Regardless of the above "at least this many" setting, the viewer will also display when the map's magnification factor is less than this number.

*Draw pieces:*::  If selected, then the included pieces will be drawn in the viewer.

*Draw pieces using zoom factor:*::  The magnification factor to use to draw the pieces in the viewer.

*Width of gap between pieces:*::  Empty space in pixels to place between each drawn piece.

*Display text:*::  If selected, then the viewer will draw some summary text and some individualized text for each piece.

*Enable HTML and "Quick Colors" in text:*:: Enable the use of <<ChatLog.adoc#html,HTML>> and  <<ChatLog.adoc#quick,Quick Colors>> in the display text.

*Center text over pieces:*:: When selected, the text displayed above each piece will be centered over the piece, otherwise it will be left-justified.

*Stretch summary text box to width of pieces:*:: Stretch the size of the summary text piece to be the same with as the display of pieces, even if it would normally be narrower.

*Additional offset upward (summary text):*:: The number of pixels to adjust the summary text box upwards from its usual position. Use negative numbers to adjust it down.

*Font size:*:: Fort size for the text drawn by the stack viewer.

*Summary text above pieces:*::  A <<MessageFormat.adoc#top,Message Format>> specifying the text to display above the drawn pieces in the viewer.
In addition to standard <<Properties.adoc#top,Properties>>, you can include $countPieces$ to count the pieces included in the display. You can also include a property with the name _sum(propertyName)_ where _propertyName_ is a property defined on a Game Piece.
The sum of the numeric values of this property for all included pieces will be substituted. **Note:** If you are using a Beanshell expression here instead of just substitution with $..$ then for _sum_ you will need to use _sumProperties_ as Beanshell has its own separate sum keyword as documented in <<Expression.adoc#top, Expressions>>.

*Text below each piece:*::  A <<MessageFormat.adoc#top,Message Format>> specifying the text to display below each included piece.

*Text for empty location:*::  A <<MessageFormat.adoc#top,Message Format>> specifying the text to display when no pieces have been selected.

*Include individual pieces:*::  Specifies whether/how pieces are to be selected for inclusion in the viewer based on their layer.
You may restrict the pieces according to the <<GamePieceLayers.adoc#top,Game Piece Layer>> to which they belong.

*Property Match Expression:*::  You may specify a <<PropertyMatchExpression.adoc#top,Property Match Expression>> to match desired values of one or more <<Properties.adoc#top,Properties>> in order for a piece to be included.

*Include non-stacking pieces:*::  If selected, then pieces with a <<NonStacking.adoc#top,Does not stack>> trait specifying the piece does not Stack are eligible for inclusion in the viewer.
Otherwise, they are excluded regardless of any other filters.

*Include move-when-selected pieces:*::  If selected, then pieces with a <<NonStacking.adoc#top,Does not stack>> trait specifying the piece may only move when selected are eligible for inclusion in the viewer.
Otherwise, they are excluded regardless of any other filters.

*Include non-movable pieces:*::  If selected, then pieces with a <<NonStacking.adoc#top,Does not stack>> trait specifying the piece may not move are eligible for inclusion in the viewer.
Otherwise, they are excluded regardless of any other filters.

*Show pieces in unrotated state:*::  If selected, then pieces that can rotate are drawn in the viewer as they look when not rotated.

*Include top piece in Deck:*:: If selected, then the top piece of a <<Deck.adoc#top,Deck>> is eligible for inclusion.

*Include face down pieces in a Deck:*:: If selected, then face-down members of a deck are eligible for inclusion

*Number of pieces in Deck to show:*:: This many cards/pieces from the top of a deck are eligible for inclusion.

*Show all pieces overlapping the first piece found:*:: If selected, then all Game Pieces that overlap the mouse cursor location are eligible to be displayed; otherwise only pieces at the _exact_ X,Y position of the _top_ piece found are displayed.
