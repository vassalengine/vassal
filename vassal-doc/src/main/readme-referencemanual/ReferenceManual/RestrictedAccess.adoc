=== Restricted Access

This trait allows you to specify player side(s) to whom this piece belongs.
The side(s) must be chosen from among those listed in the module's <<GameModule.adoc#Definition_of_Player_Sides,Definition of Player Sides.>> Only players playing one of the specified sides will be able to modify certain traits of this Game Piece.
Other players will not see menu items corresponding to traits appearing _before_ this trait in the list of traits for the Game Piece, and the corresponding key commands will do nothing.
Thus, this trait is similar to <<Hideable.adoc#top,Invisible>> traits and <<Mask.adoc#top,Mask>> traits in that it should be placed below the traits it is intended to "protect".

Pieces in a Game Piece Palette can be manipulated by anybody so long as no game is in progress.

*Description:*:: A brief description of the purpose of this trait for your own reference.

*Belongs to side:*::  Enter the list of sides to whom this piece belongs.

*Also belongs to initially-placing player:*:: When this option is checked, then the player who initially clicks on the piece or first places it on any map will become the owner, in addition to listed sides.
+
It is a good idea to specify at least one side when using this option.
Otherwise, any pieces created by an observer will not be able to be removed.
If, during a game, a player clicks the _Retire_ button to become an observer, then all pieces owned by that player become owned by nobody, even if the player was already an observer.

NOTE: If you are creating a <<GameModule.adoc#PredefinedSetup,Pre-defined Setup>>, always _Retire_ before saving so that players loading the game, rather than you, will own the pieces in the setup.

*Prevent non-owning players from moving piece:*::  Use this option to prevent non-owning players from moving the piece, as well as disabling access to the piece commands.
