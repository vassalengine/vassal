=== Grid Numbering

[cols=",",]
|===
|Specifies how identifying names/numbers are assigned to cells in a <<HexGrid.adoc#top,Hex Grid>> or <<RectangularGrid.adoc#top,Rectangular Grid>> on a <<Board.adoc#top,Board>>, and whether the names are to be drawn on top of the board image.

*Order:*  Label cells by row/column vs.
column/row.

*Separator:*  Text to place between the row and column, such as a comma.

*Numbering:*  Alphabetical (A,B,C, ... AA, BB, CC, etc.) vs.
Numeric (1,2,3 ...).

*Descending:*  If checked, numbering of rows/columns begins on the bottom/right edge of the board.

*Leading Zeros:*  One leading zero means always use two digits for the row/column.
Two leading zeros mean always use three digits, etc.

*Starting Number:*  The number of the first cell ('A' == 0 if using alphabetic numbering).

*Location format:*  The <<MessageFormat.adoc#top,Message Format>> used to populate a piece's LocationName <<Properties.adoc#top,Property>> and for reporting locations within a map window (e.g.
for move reporting): _gridLocation_ is the name as drawn on the sample grid.
This is useful for prepending a board name, for example.

*Draw Numbering:*  If checked, the numbering of the grid will be drawn on top of the board image.

*Font size:*  Size of the font to use when drawing the numbering.

*Color:* Color to use when drawing the numbering.

*Rotate Text:* Orientation of the numbering text.

*Text X offset:* Distance in pixels to the right (relative to the text's orientation) of its default position that the text will be drawn.
By default, text is center-justified at the top of the cell.

*Text Y offset:* Distance in pixels downward (relative to the text's orientation) of its default position that the text will be drawn.
By default, text is center-justified at the top of the cell.

*Odd-numbered rows numbered higher:*  For hex grids only.
If checked, then the first number of staggered columns on the grid will be one greater than non-staggered columns.
