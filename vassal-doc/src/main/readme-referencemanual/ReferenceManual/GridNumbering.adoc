=== Grid Numbering

[cols=",",]
|=================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
|Specifies how identifying names/numbers are assigned to cells in a <<HexGrid.adoc#top,Hex Grid>> or <<RectangularGrid.adoc#top,Rectangular Grid>> on a <<Board.adoc#top,Board>>, and whether the names are to be drawn on top of the board image. +
 +
*Order:*  Label cells by row/column vs. column/row. +
 +
*Separator:*  Text to place between the row and column, such as a comma. +
 +
*Numbering:*  Alphabetical (A,B,C, ... AA, BB, CC, etc.) vs. Numeric (1,2,3 ...). +
 +
*Descending:*  If checked, numbering of rows/columns begins on the bottom/right edge of the board. +
 +
*Leading Zeros:*  One leading zero means always use two digits for the row/column. Two leading zeros mean always use three digits, etc. +
 +
*Starting Number:*  The number of the first cell ('A' == 0 if using alphabetic numbering). +
 +
*Location format:*  The <<MessageFormat.adoc#top,Message Format>> used to populate a piece's LocationName <<Properties.adoc#top,Property>> and for reporting locations within a map window (e.g. for move reporting): _gridLocation_ is the name as drawn on the sample grid. This is useful for prepending a board name, for example. +
 +
*Draw Numbering:*  If checked, the numbering of the grid will be drawn on top of the board image. +
 +
*Font size:*  Size of the font to use when drawing the numbering. +
 +
**Color: **Color to use when drawing the numbering. +
 +
**Rotate Text: **Orientation of the numbering text. +
 +
**Text X offset: **Distance in pixels to the right (relative to the text's orientation) of its default position that the text will be drawn. By default, text is center-justified at the top of the cell. +
 +
**Text Y offset: **Distance in pixels downward (relative to the text's orientation) of its default position that the text will be drawn. By default, text is center-justified at the top of the cell. +
 +
*Odd-numbered rows numbered higher:*  For hex grids only. If checked, then the first number of staggered columns on the grid will be one greater than non-staggered columns. +
