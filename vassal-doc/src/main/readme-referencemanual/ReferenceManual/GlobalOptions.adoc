=== Global Options

[cols=",",]
|===
|The Global Options component allows you to define your own custom preferences for a module.
It also contains other settings that apply to the module as a whole, as well as providing a location to configure button images and hotkeys for some of the basic Toolbar buttons.
If an option has a _Use Preferences Setting_ choice, selecting it will add an entry to the Preferences window to allow players to choose their own setting at game time.

*Allow non-owners to unmask pieces:*  By default, only the player who originally masked a piece (see the Mask trait for Game Pieces) is allowed to unmask it.
This option allows other players to unmask a masked piece.

*Center on opponent's moves:*  This option will center a map window on an opponent's move when reading a logfile or receiving a move on the server.
_It is recommended that in most cases this be set to "Use Preferences" so that players can turn this behavior on and off themselves._

*Auto-report moves:*  This option will automatically report a text description (e.g.
"3rd Cav moves A10 ->B11") to the chat log of the control window whenever a player moves a piece in a Map Window.

*Player Id format:* A <<MessageFormat.adoc#top,Message Format>> that is used to identify players when typing chat text.
It is available for use as a short-cut in other message formats such as move auto-reporting as well.

*Enable HTML Support in Chat Log:*  This option, if enabled, will allow messages sent to the <<ChatLog.adoc#top,Chat Log>> to include HTML tags.
It is recommended that for new modules you set this option to _Always_, as the other settings exist only to maintain compatibility with VASSAL modules created before HTML support existed that might have included symbols in their text messages, e.g.
< > which could otherwise be misinterpreted as HTML tags.

*Icons and hotkeys:*You can specify your own button icons and keyboard shortcuts for the logfile step/undo buttons and the button that shows/hides the server controls.
