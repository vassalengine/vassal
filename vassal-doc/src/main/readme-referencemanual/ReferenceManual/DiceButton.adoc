=== Dice Button
A Dice Button adds a toolbar button that implements the rolling and reporting of a set of Dice.

The number of dice to roll can either be fixed for every roll, or can be entered by the user for each roll.

==== Properties
A Dice Button exports its results to 3 Global Properties that are accessible from other Vassal components. These properties will keep their values until the next roll, including in save games and logs.

Each property name is of the form <DiceButtonName>_<property>. The three properties exported are:

* result - the value of the $result$ report format variable.
* total - the value of the $numericTotal$ report format variable.
* keep - the value of the $keepCount$ report format variable.

(_Example:_ A dice button is named "2d6". After a roll of 11, the Global Property named *2d6_result* will resolve to "11" until the next roll, assuming the _Report Total_ option has been checked, or "5,6" if not. The property *2d6_total* will contain "11" and the property *2d6_keep* will contain "2".

+
_$name$_::: Name of the button. +
_$result$_::: The result of the roll, either a list of the rolls, or the total of all rolls if the _Report Total_ option is checked. +
_$result#$_::: The result of each individial roll. e.g. $result1$, $result2$. +
_$numericTotal$_::: The total of all dice rolls, regardless of the setting of the _Report Total_ option. +
_$nDice$_::: The number of dice rolled. +
_$nSides$_::: The number of sides on each die. +
_$plus$_::: The modifier added to each die. +
_$addToTotal$_::: The modifer added to the total. +
_$keepDice$_::: The number of dice that were requested to be kept. This will be the _Value of N_ if one of the _keep_ options was selected, otherwise it will be the same as $nDice$. +
_$keepCount$_::: The actual number of dice that were kept.

*Prompt for values when button pushed:*:: When unselected, that values for the following 4 fields are fixed for all dice rolls. When selected, the user is prompted for these values in a popup window when the Dice Button is activated.

*Sort dice results:*:: When checked, the rolls that are kept will be sorted in order from smallest to largest when being reported.

_Keep rolls >= N_::: Only keep rolls greater than or equal to a specific value. +
_Keep rolls == N_::: Only keep rolls equal to a specific number. +
