=== Mat

Mats are generally larger pieces that are designed to have smaller pieces (<<MatCargo.adoc#top,Mat Cargo>>) placed on top of them, and for the
cargo pieces to move along with the Mat and maintain their relative position.

When a <<GamePiece.adoc#top,Game Piece>> with this trait is selected by left-clicking on it, any game pieces with the <<MatCargo.adoc#top,Mat Cargo>>
trait that have been placed on top of the Mat piece will also become selected automatically. Therefore if the Mat game
piece is then moved with a drag-and-drop, the cargo pieces conveniently move along with it and maintain their relative
positions.

Similarly, when a Mat piece is moved with a <<SendToLocation.adoc#top,Send to Location>> trait or a <<Translate.adoc#top,Move Fixed Distance>> trait, cargo pieces on top
of it will follow.

If a Mat piece is <<Rotate.adoc#top,rotated>> or <<Pivot.adoc#top,pivoted>>, any cargo pieces on top can also match their facing to the Mat, if that option is
selected in the Mat Cargo trait.

==== Properties

A Mat trait exposes the following <<Properties.adoc#top,Properties>>:

* _MatName_ contains the name of the Mat, taken from the _Mat Name_ field.

* _MatID_ contains a unique identifying string for the Mat piece: even two pieces sharing the same Mat Name will have different Mat ID's.

* _MatNumCargo_ contains the number of Mat Cargo pieces currently sitting on this mat.
