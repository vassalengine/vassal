=== Deselect

A <<GamePiece.adoc#top,Game Piece>> with this trait will have a command that causes the piece to be removed from any player selection (currently selected pieces, drag-selection, drag-and-drop grouping, etc.)

|*Description:*:: A short description of this trait for your own reference.

*Menu Command:*:: Menu text for the _Deselect_ command for the right-click context menu. If left blank then no menu item will be displayed but the _Key Command_ can still be used.

*Key command:*:: <<NamedKeyCommand.adoc#top,Keystroke or Named Command>> that will cause the piece to become deselected.

*Remove piece from stack:*:: If checked, then when this trait is activated the piece will _also_ be removed from any Stack it is a part of. This can be useful in games that involve "dropping off and picking up" units from armies, because a <<Marker.adoc#top,Place Marker>> trait will normally add the new marker to the current stack.
