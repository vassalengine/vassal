=== Action Button

An Action Button component places a button on the Toolbar of the main Module window which combines a number of different actions into a single button.
When the button is clicked, or receives its Hotkey, it can display a message to the Chat Log Window, Play a sound, and/or send a list of Hotkeys or <<NamedKeyCommand.adoc#top,Named Key Commands>> to other components.

To add an Action Button to your Module, find the _[Module]_ entry at the very top of the Editor's configuration window, right-click it, and select _Add Action Button_.
Once you have performed the initial configuration of your new Action Button and clicked the OK button, your new _[Action Button]_ component will be found at the very bottom of the Module's list of components.

*Description:* An identifying name for this button.

*Button text:* The text of the button to be added to the Toolbar.

*Button Tooltip text:* The tooltip text of the button to be added to the Toolbar.

*Button Icon:* Icon for the Toolbar button.

*Hotkey:* Keyboard shortcut or <<NamedKeyCommand.adoc#top,Named Key Command>> for the Toolbar button.

**Display Message? **Select to display a message to the chat log when the Action Button is clicked or its Hotkey received.

*Report Format:* <<MessageFormat.adoc#top,Message Format>> to report to the chat log.

**Play a sound? **Select to play a sound clip when the button is activated.

*Sound Clip:* The Sound clip file to be played.

**Send Hotkeys? **Select to send Hotkeys to other components when the button is activated.

*Hot Keys:* The list of Hotkeys or <<NamedKeyCommand.adoc#top,Named Key Commands>> to be sent.
Use the New button to add another key, or the Remove buttons to remove existing keys.
*NOTE:* because these are _Global Hotkeys_ rather than _Global Key Commands_, they are sent to Module and Map Toolbar components, _not_ to individual Game Pieces.
Of course a Hotkey could be used to activate a Global Key Command component which could then affect individual Game Pieces.

**Repeat this set of actions (Loop)? **Allows you to perform the specified actions multiple times.

**Repeat fixed number of times **This loop option allows you to repeat the set of actions a specified number of times.

**Repeat while condition is true **This loop option allows you to repeat the set of actions while a <<PropertyMatchExpression.adoc#top,Property Expression>> remains true.
If the expression begins the loop already false, the actions will not be performed at all (compare "until", below).

**Repeat until condition is true **This loop option allows you to repeat the set of actions until a <<PropertyMatchExpression.adoc#top,Property Expression>> becomes true.
The set of actions will be performed at least once.

**Loop how many times? **An <<Expression.adoc#top,Expression>> that defines how many times to generate the set of actions (for a fixed loop).

*Loop while/until condition is true:* Enter the <<PropertyMatchExpression.adoc#top,Property Expression>> that controls how long to keep looping (for a while or until loop).

*Perform this KeyStroke once before looping starts:* For all loop types, enter a HotKey or <<NamedKeyCommand.adoc#top,Named Key Command>> that will be performed once before the looping process commences.

*Perform this KeyStroke once after looping complete:* For all loop types, enter a HotKey or <<NamedKeyCommand.adoc#top,Named Key Command>> that will be performed once after the looping process finishes.

**Create a Loop Index Property? **For all loop types, allows you to create a Property whose value will changes as the looping process proceeds.

*Index Property Name:* The name of the property that will be created.

*Index Property start value:* An <<Expression.adoc#top,Expression>> that sets the value of the index property prior to looping commencing.
The expression must evaluate to a whole number.

*Index Property increment value:* An <<Expression.adoc#top,Expression>> that defines how much will be added to the Index Property at the start of each loop.
The expression must evaluate to a whole number.
