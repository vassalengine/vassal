=== Game Piece Layouts

[width="100%",cols="50%,<50%",]
|===
a|
This component contains all the layouts used to define a <<GamePieceImage.adoc#top,Game Piece Image>>.  Right-click on the _[Game Piece Layouts]_ component and select _Add Game Piece Layout_ to add a new layout.

A Game Piece Layout defines the general look and layout of the items used in drawing an image.
Specific color and text information is defined later for individual piece images in the Game Piece Image properties.

*NOTE:*  Once you have configured your new Game Piece Layout, you will need to right click on its _[Game Piece Layout]_ entry and select _Add Game Piece Image_ to create one or more individual images based on your layout.

An image is built up by drawing in order:

. [.li]#A rectangle of the background color.#
. [.li]#A border.#
. [.li]#Each defined item in the order displayed in the Item panel.#

*Name:* The name of the Image Layout.

*Counter Width:* The width of all images created using this layout.

*Counter Height:* The height of all images created using this layout.

*Border Style:* The border style for all images created using this layout.
Border styles currently available are:

* [.li]#None - No Border#
* [.li]#Plain - Single pixel line of defined color.#
* [.li]#Fancy - Two pixel shaded line of defined color.
Mild 3D effect.#
* [.li]#3D - A 3D-style shaded border.
Two pixels wide, colour automatically determined from background color.#

*Reduce Images to 256 Colors:* This option results in smaller module files and will not degrade image quality unless the counters use high-resolution photographic images

==== Symbol Item

[width="100%",cols="50%,<50%",]
|===
a|
A Symbol Item is a generic symbol to be drawn by the program.
  An Infantry symbol will be shown as a placeholder but the particular symbol is chosen later when configuring an individual <<GamePieceImage.adoc#top,Game Piece Image>>.

* +
Name:*  The name of the item.
Items *MUST* be uniquely named within an Image Layout.

*Location:*  Select the location of the item on the counter.

*Symbol Set:*  Select the Symbol Set to use.
The only Symbol Set currently available is NATO Unit Symbols.

*Width:*  The width of the body of the symbol in pixels.

*Height:*  The height of the body of the symbol (not including the Size specifier) in pixels.

*Line Width:* The width of the line (in pixels)used to draw the symbol.
Fractional line widths can be used.
The lines are drawn with antialiasing turned on to produce smooth looking lines of any width.
When using a small symbol size, a line width of 1.0 will usually give the best results.

==== Label Items

[width="100%",cols="50%,<50%",]
|===

*Location:*  Select the location of the item on the counter.
The location also determines the text justification, i.e.
