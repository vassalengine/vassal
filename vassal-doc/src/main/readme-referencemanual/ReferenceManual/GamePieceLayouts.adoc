=== Game Piece Layouts

This component contains all the layouts used to define a <<GamePieceImage.adoc#top,Game Piece Image>>.  Right-click on the _[Game Piece Layouts]_ component and select _Add Game Piece Layout_ to add a new layout.

A Game Piece Layout defines the general look and layout of the items used in drawing an image.
Specific color and text information is defined later for individual piece images in the Game Piece Image properties.

NOTE:  Once you have configured your new Game Piece Layout, you will need to right-click on its _[Game Piece Layout]_ entry and select _Add Game Piece Image_ to create one or more individual images based on your layout.

An image is built up by drawing in order:

. [.li]#A rectangle of the background color.#
. [.li]#A border.#
. [.li]#Each defined item in the order displayed in the Item panel.#

==== Advanced Options
Each item type has a checkbox to enable a set of advanced options to better control the position and display of the item.

[width="100%",cols="50%a,^50%a",]

==== Symbol Item
A Symbol Item is a generic symbol to be drawn by the program.
An Infantry symbol will be shown as a placeholder but the particular symbol is chosen later when configuring an individual <<GamePieceImage.adoc#top,Game Piece Image>>.

[width="100%",cols="50%a,^50%a",]

|
*Name:*::  The name of the item.

*Line width:*:: The width of the line (in pixels) used to draw the symbol.

The lines are drawn with antialiasing turned on to produce smooth looking lines of any width.
When using a small symbol size, a line width of 1.0 will usually give the best results.

==== Label Items
A Label Item is a text label drawn in a particular font at a particular location.
The value of the text can be specified in the individual images or in the layout, in which case all images using this layout share the same value.

Items *MUST* be uniquely named within an Image Layout.

*Location:*::  Select the location of the item on the counter.
The location also determines the text justification, i.e.
selecting Top Left ensures that the upper left corner of the text is in the upper left corner of the image.
Once the justification is set by the Location, you can still use the X/Y offset in the advanced options to place the text in a different location.

*Font style:*::  Select the name of the Font Style to be used for this Text Item.

*Text option:*:: Select how the text is provided for each image created using this layout:

*Name:*::  The name of the item.
Items *MUST* be uniquely named within an Image Layout.

*Location:*::  Select the location of the item on the counter.
The location also determines the text justification, i.e.

Once the justification is set by the Location, you can still use the X/Y offset in the advanced options to place the text in a different location.

*Use HTML:*::  If selected, then the contents will be interpreted as HTML.

*Font style:*::  Select the name of the Font Style to be used for this Text Item.

*Text option:*:: Select how the text is provided for each image created using this layout:
