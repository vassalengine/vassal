=== Line Of Sight Thread

The Line of Sight allows players to use the mouse to draw a line between 2 points on the map to check for the availability of a _Line of Sight_ between the two points.

There is no automatic checking if a _Line of Sight_ exists by Vassal, this is up to the players to determine.

The Line of Sight component adds a Toolbar button to initiate the LOS display.

*Hotkey:*:: Specifies a <<NamedKeyCommand.adoc#top,Keystroke or Named Command>> for the Toolbar button.

*Report format:*:: A <<MessageFormat.adoc#top,Message Format>> to display a message when a Line of Sight is finished being drawn. The following additional Properties can be used:
+
_$FromLocation$_ - The grid location of start of the LOS.
+
_$ToLocation$_ - The grid location of the end of
the LOS.

+
_$NumberOfLocationsChecked$_ - The number of different grid cells that the end of the LOS was dragged over.
+
_$AllLocationsChecked$_ - A list of all of the grid locations of the different grid cells that the end of the LOS was dragged over.

*Persistence:*:: Defines whether the LOS remains visible after the mouse is released to finish drawing the LOS. Options are:
+
_Never_ - The LOS will never persist.
+
_Always_ - The LOS will always persist
+
_Ctrl+Click & drag_ - The LOS will persist if the Ctrl key is held down while drawing the LOS.
+
NOTE: A persisting LOS can be cleared by clicking on the LOS toolbar button again.

*Visible to opponent:*:: Controls whether a LOS one player draws is visible to other players. Options are:
+
_Never_ - The LOS is never visible to opponents.
+
_Always_ - The LOS is always visible to opponents.
+
_When persisting_ - The LOS is visible to opponents if it is persisting.

*Force start of thread to snap to grid:*:: If unchecked, the LOS will start where the mouse is clicked. If checked, the LOS will start at the nearest snap point defined by the map grid.

*Force end of thread to snap to grid:*:: If unchecked, the end of the LOS will follow the mouse cursor. If checked, the end of the LOS will jump to the nearest snap point defined by the map grid.

*Draw range:*:: If checked, draws the range between the two points, in the current grid units of the board (hexes, squares or pixels).

*Pixels per range unit (0 to use Grid calculation):*::  If drawing the range on a board without a grid, this determines how many pixels on the screen equal a single unit of range.

*Round fractions:*:: For distances that are a fraction of a range unit, specify whether to round fractions up, down, or to the nearest whole number.

*Hide pieces while drawing:*::  If checked, then all game pieces in the map will be hidden (or transparent) while the thread is being drawn.

*Opacity of hidden pieces (0-100%):*::  Set the transparency of game pieces while the thread is being drawn.
0 is completely transparent, 100 is completely opaque.

*Color:*::  Specifies the color of the LOS thread on the screen.
+
If set to null (by clicking the "Select" button and then the "Cancel" button in the color-choosing dialog), then a Preferences option will determine the color of the thread at game time.
