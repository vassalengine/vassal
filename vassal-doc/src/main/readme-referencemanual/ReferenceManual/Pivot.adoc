=== Can Pivot

This trait allows a piece to pivot around a fixed point relative to its current position.
This trait only functions if the piece also has a <<Rotate.adoc#top,Can Rotate>> trait _and_ the _Can Rotate_ trait appears _before_ the Can Pivot trait in the <<GamePiece.adoc#TraitOrder,trait list>>.

*Description:*:: A brief description for your own reference.

*Menu command:*:: The right-click context menu entry to pivot the piece.
If left blank, no context menu entry will appear but the piece can still be pivoted with the Key Command, below.

*Key command:*::  The <<NamedKeyCommand.adoc#top,Keystroke or Named Command>> that will pivot the piece.

*Pivot point:*:: The location, relative to the center of the piece and its current facing, around which the piece will rotate.
Positive numbers are down and to the right.
+
_Example:_ For a piece of size 40x40, a pivot point of 20,-20 will rotate the piece around its upper right corner.

*Pivot through fixed angle:*::  If selected, then invoking the command will pivot the piece through the angle specified in the _Angle_ field, in degrees clockwise.
If left unselected, then invoking the command will allow the player to pivot the piece interactively to any angle by dragging the mouse. If a fixed angle is selected,
then an _additional_ angle, along with an additional Menu Command and Key Command, can also be selected -- allowing, for example, commands to pivot both "forwards" and "backwards".
