=== Game Piece Image

This component uses a layout created in a <<GamePieceLayouts.adoc#top,Game Piece Layout>> component to create an actual image.
Here, you specify the colors, text, and images to use in the layout, as well as the name under which this image will appear in the image-chooser drop-down.
You can then begin using this image in any other Vassal component or trait as if you had loaded it in from an external source.

*Name:*:: Specify a name for the image definition.
This is the name under which this image will appear in the image-chooser drop-down menu in a Game Piece trait's properties. Vassal enforces that the name contains only letters, numbers or the _ character and ends in '.png'.

NOTE: Older versions of Vassal prior to version 3.6 allowed for any string of characters to be used for a filename. This is not advisable as it can cause the module to fail to work correctly.

*Background color:*:: Select a background color to use behind the whole image from the dropdown list of available colors, or click the _Cancel_ button on that dialog to use a transparent background. Additional colors can be added as a <<GamePieceImageDefinitions.adoc#NamedColors,Named Color>>.

The next section shows a visualization of what the finished image will look like with your choices.

The Items panel shows the configurable items that make up your image layout.
Click on an item to display the options available for that item in the bottom configuration panel.
There is a different configuration panel for each type of item.
