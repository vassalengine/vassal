=== Game Piece Image

This component uses a layout created in a <<GamePieceLayouts.adoc#top,Game Piece Layout>> component to create an actual image.
Here, you specify the colors, text, and images to use in the layout, as well as the name under which this image will appear in the image-chooser drop-down.
You can then begin adding this image to Game Pieces, either in their <<BasicPiece.adoc#top,Basic Piece>> component or in a <<Layer.adoc#top,Layer>>.
