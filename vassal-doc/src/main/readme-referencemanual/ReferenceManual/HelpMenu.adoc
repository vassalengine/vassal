You may add more help files specific to the module you are creating by right clicking on the _[Help Menu]_ component in the Editor and selecting the appropriate _Add_ option.

This can also be used to include a PDF file, e.g.
of a rulebook, in your module (see <<#PDF,Using PDF Files>> , below).

==== Using PDF Files:

To include a PDF file on your help menu, follow these steps:

* Put your PDF in a directory on its own on your hard drive (e.g.
in a "help" subdirectory of where you keep your original art files, etc)
* Right click the _[Help Menu]_ component in the Editor and select _Add HTML Help File_.
* For the menu entry, type "Rulebook" or whatever you want displayed as the actual Help Menu entry.
* Set the _Contents_ to the directory (on your hard drive, not in the Vassal vmod/zip file)
* Set the _Starting Page_ as the PDF file name.
* Save the module and you should be good to go.
