=== Does not stack

The _Does not stack_ trait's primary function is that it prevents a piece from forming stacks with other pieces on the board.
Pieces with this trait can be placed at any pixel location on a map, and they will simply overlap with and/or partially or completely obscure or be obscured by any pieces they are placed on top of or beneath.

This trait _also_ controls how players interact with the piece when clicking on it, dragging it, or dragging a band-select box around a group of pieces.
Note that any selection or movement limitations do not apply when the piece is moved automatically through the operation of one of its traits (e.g.
a <<SendToLocation.adoc#top,Send To Location>> trait).

The _Does not stack_ now has an option to over-ride its primary function and allow the piece to Stack normally,
giving access to the selection, movevement and Ignore Grid options for Stackable pieces.

*EXAMPLE:* Use non-stacking pieces to represent playing cards in games that mix cards and counters, so that the cards can be placed on a map without interfering with stacks of counters.

*EXAMPLE:* Pieces that represent map features, such as destroyed bridges or control markers, can use the _Move piece never_ option so that players do not inadvertently move them around.
They could also be filtered out of band-selects, while still being allowed to be selected when clicked on directly, so that players can still modify and/or delete them as the game progresses.

*Select piece:*::  This option controls what happens when a player tries to select a piece, e.g.
by clicking on it.
Options are:

* _normally:_  The piece can be selected normally.
* _when shift-key down:_  A player must hold the Shift key down to select the piece.
* _when alt-key down:_  A player must hold the Alt key down to select the piece.
* _when ctrl-key down (cmd-key on Mac):_ A player must hold the Ctrl key (Cmd key on a Mac) down to select the piece.
* _never:_  The piece can never be selected by a player.

*Band-Select piece:*::  This option controls what happens when a player draws a band-select box or "lasso" around a group of pieces and this piece lies within the boundaries of the band-select.
This can be used to prevent e.g.
a certain class of terrain markers or immobile markers from being swept up in band-selects when only pieces are desired, but still allowing these markers to be clicked on directly and be selected.

* _normally:_  The piece can be band-selected normally.
* _when alt-key down:_  A player must hold the Alt key down when band-selecting in order for this piece to be added to the selection.
* _when alt+shift keys down:_ A player must hold the Alt and Shift keys down when band-selecting in order for this piece to be added to the selection.
* _never:_  The piece is never selected by band-selects.

*Move Piece:*:: This option controls what happens when a player tries to move a selected piece by drag-and-drop.
Options are:

* _normally:_  The piece can be moved normally.
* _only if selected:_  The piece can only be moved if it is selected.
* _never:_  The piece can never be moved manually by a player.

*Piece can stack:*:: This option controls whether the piece can form Stacks with other pieces when moved. This option
allows you to over-ride the primary _Does Not Stack_ behaviour of this trait, and apply the other options to Stacking pieces.
+
NOTE: Some combinations of the selection and movement options may not make much sense when used with a Stacking counter.
+
The primary purpose
of this option is to allow the _Ignore grid when moving?_ option to be applied to Stacking pieces:

* _normally:_  The piece will stack normally.
* _never:_  The piece can never form stacks with other pieces (default).

*Ignore grid when moving:*:: Select this option to prevent the piece from snapping to the nearest grid location when it is moved.
This overrides any setting configured in a <<HexGrid.adoc#top,Hex Grid>>, <<IrregularGrid.adoc#top,Irregular Grid>>, or <<RectangularGrid.adoc#top,Rectangular Grid>>.
