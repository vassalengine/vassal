=== Invisible
This trait gives a Game Piece the capability to be made invisible to opponents and other non-owning players.
Specify the key which the user will press to make the piece invisible (or a <<NamedKeyCommand.adoc#top,Named Command>>) and the name for the command that will appear in the right-click context menu.
The same command turns the invisible piece visible again.
To the player who turned it invisible, the piece will appear transparent against a background of the specified color.
To other players it will not appear at all.

This piece sets the <<Properties.adoc#top,Property>> _InvisibleToOthers=true_ when invisible.

NOTE:  _This trait actually only hides those traits which appear *before* it in the list of traits, so it should generally be the <<GamePiece.adoc#TraitOrder,last trait>> of a Game Piece._
