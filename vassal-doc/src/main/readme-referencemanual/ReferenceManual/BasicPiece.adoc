=== Basic Piece

The simplest game piece consists of an image and a name.

The image is optional, or different pieces can share the same image, but you should always give each Basic Piece a unique name.

Simple piece images can be created from scratch within Vassal using <<GamePieceImageDefinitions.adoc#top,Game Piece Image Definitions>>, but you will usually get a better result by loading images sourced from existing artwork or created with specialist graphics software.

To give a piece more complex behaviors, you can add more Traits to it in the <<GamePiece.adoc#top,Piece Definer>> dialog.
For example you could omit or remove the image from the Basic Piece and instead add a <<Layer.adoc#top,Layer>> trait to allow the piece to use multiple images.

The following <<Properties.adoc#top,Properties>> are defined in a Basic Piece, meaning that any trait in the piece can refer to them:

* _BasicName_ contains the name of Basic Piece trait, as specified in the properties

<<Layer.adoc#top,Layer>> or <<Label.adoc#top,Text Label>> traits
* _PlayerSide_ contains the side of the current player, as specified in the <<GameModule.adoc#Definition_of_Player_Sides,Definition of Player Sides>>
* _LocationName_ contains the name of the current location, as determined by the local grid.
If the piece is in a <<ZonedGrid.adoc#top,Zone>> in a Multi-Zone Grid, then whether _LocationName_ returns the name of the _Zone_ or a _Region_ within the Zone's grid depends on the configuration of the <<ZonedGrid.adoc#top,Zone>>. +
* _CurrentMap_ contains the name of the current <<Map.adoc#top,Map Window>> +
* _CurrentBoard_ contains the name of the current <<Board.adoc#top,Board>>

* _Selected_ contains _true_ when the piece has been selected with the mouse
* _PieceId_ contains a string that uniquely defines the source of the piece.
All pieces sourced from the same <<PieceWindow.adoc#top,Game Piece Palette>> slot will have the same PieceId string.

The following <<Properties.adoc#top,Properties>> are defined after a piece is moved, either manually by drag-and-drop movement or by a <<SendToLocation.adoc#top,Send To Location>> trait:

The following <<Properties.adoc#top,Properties>> are defined after the player has selected something from the piece's right-click context menu:
