=== Basic Piece

The simplest game piece consists of an image and a name.

The image is optional, or different pieces can share the same image, but you should always either give each Basic Piece a unique name or add a <<BasicName.adoc#top,Basic Name>> trait to provide one.

Simple piece images can be created from scratch within Vassal using <<GamePieceImageDefinitions.adoc#top,Game Piece Image Definitions>>, but you will usually get a better result by loading images sourced from existing artwork or created with specialist graphics software.

To give a piece more complex behaviors, you can add more Traits to it in the <<GamePiece.adoc#top,Piece Definer>> dialog.
For example you could omit or remove the image from the Basic Piece and instead add a <<Layer.adoc#top,Layer>> trait to allow the piece to use multiple images.

The following <<Properties.adoc#top,Properties>> are defined in a Basic Piece, meaning that any trait in the piece can refer to them:

* _BasicName_ contains the name of Basic Piece trait. Can be overridden by adding a <<BasicName.adoc#top, Basic Name>> trait to the piece.
* _PieceName_ contains the full name of the piece, including any additional strings added by e.g.
<<Layer.adoc#top,Layer>> or <<Label.adoc#top,Text Label>> traits (Note the distinction from the use of $pieceName$ with lowercase p _inside_ the <<TextLabel.adoc#top,Text Label>> trait and in a <<Map.adoc#top, Map's>> movement report fields -- those are similar but separate uses specific to those situations. The general-purpose property for a piece's traits to use to get the piece's own full name, as well as for <<PropertyMatchExpression.adoc#top, Property Match Expressions>> selecting for target pieces in a <<GlobalKeyCommand.adoc#top, Global Key Command>>, is _PieceName_ with the capital P).
* _PlayerSide_ contains the side of the current player, as specified in the <<GameModule.adoc#Definition_of_Player_Sides,Definition of Player Sides>>
* _LocationName_ contains the name of the current location, as determined by the local grid.
If the piece is in a <<ZonedGrid.adoc#top,Zone>> in a Multi-Zone Grid, then whether _LocationName_ returns the name of the _Zone_ or a _Region_ within the Zone's grid depends on the configuration of the <<ZonedGrid.adoc#top,Zone>>. +
* _CurrentMap_ contains the name of the current <<Map.adoc#top,Map Window>> +
* _CurrentBoard_ contains the name of the current <<Board.adoc#top,Board>>
* _CurrentZone_ contains the name of the current <<ZonedGrid.adoc#top,Zone>>
* _CurrentX_ contains the current map X coordinate
* _CurrentY_ contains the current map Y coordinate
* _DeckName_ contains the name of the <<Deck.adoc#top,Deck>> if the piece is currently stacked in one.
* _DeckPosition_ contains the position of a piece within a <<Deck.adoc#top,Deck>> (top = 1) if the piece is currently stacked in one, or 0 otherwise.
* _Selected_ contains _true_ when the piece has been selected with the mouse
* _PieceId_ contains a string that uniquely defines the source of the piece.
All pieces sourced from the same <<PieceWindow.adoc#top,Game Piece Palette>> slot will have the same PieceId string.
* _DrawingMouseover_ contains _true_ when a <<MouseOver.adoc#top, Mouseover Stack Viewer>> is currently being drawn, and contains _false_ otherwise.
* _DrawingMouseoverIndex_ contains 2 when a <<MouseOver.adoc#top, Mouseover Stack Viewer>> is currently being drawn, and contains 1 otherwise. This can be used e.g. in the _Follows Expression_ field of a <<Layer.adoc#top, Layer trait>> to draw a different image for the Mouseover than is normally used when drawing the piece on the map.

* _StackPos_ contains the position of the piece within the piece's current Stack, 1 being the top. If the piece is a Non-stacking piece, StackPos will return 1.

* _StackSize_ contains the number of pieces in the piece's current Stack. If the piece is a Non-stacking piece, StackSize will return 1.

The following <<Properties.adoc#top,Properties>> are defined after a piece is moved, either manually by drag-and-drop movement or by a <<SendToLocation.adoc#top,Send To Location>> trait:

* _OldLocationName_ contains the name of the previous location, as determined by the local grid +
* _OldMap_ contains the name of the previous <<Map.adoc#top,Map Window>> +
* _OldBoard_ contains the name of the previous <<Board.adoc#top,Board>>
* _OldZone_ contains the name of the previous <<ZonedGrid.adoc#top,Zone>>
* _OldX_ contains the previous map X coordinate
* _OldY_ contains the previous map Y coordinate
* _OldDeckName_ contains the name of any deck the piece was in before its last move (will be an empty string if piece wasn't in a deck)
* _OldMat_ contains the previous <<Mat.adoc#top,Mat>>, if this is a <<MatCargo.adoc#top, Mat Cargo>> piece.
* _OldMatID_ contains the previous <<Mat.adoc#top,Mat>> ID, if this is a <<MatCargo.adoc#top, Mat Cargo>> piece.
* _OldMatPieceName_ contains the previous Mat's Piece Name
* _OldMatBasicName_ contains the previous Mat's Basic Name

The following <<Properties.adoc#top,Properties>> are defined after the player has selected something from the piece's right-click context menu:

* _ClickedX_ contains the X location on current map where right-click took place.

* _ClickedY_ contains the Y location on current map where right-click took place.
