=== Rectangular Grid
A standard rectangular grid for regulating movement on a Board.
[width="100%",cols="50%a,^50%a",]
|===
|

*X,Y offset:*:: The horizontal and vertical position of the center of the first cell of the grid

*Cell width/height:*:: Pixel dimensions of each cell.

*Range calculation metric:*:: Determines the algorithm to be used in range calculations.
+
*_Metric_* range uses the larger of the X distance and the Y distance in cells.
+
*_Manhattan_* range uses the sum of the X distance and the Y distance, in cells.

*Snap to defined point:*:: If checked, pieces placed anywhere within the grid will automatically snap to the nearest legal location.
+
By default, the only legal location is the center of each grid cell.
+
If unchecked, pieces may be placed anywhere.
+
If it is useful for most pieces to snap to legal locations, but for certain types of markers to be allowed anywhere, this can be accomplished by checking this box but adding a <<NonStacking.adoc#top,Does Not Stack>> trait to the pieces which should ignore the grid and selecting the trait's "Ignore map grid when moving" option.

*Edges are legal locations:*:: If snapping is enabled, then an additional snap point is created at the center of each grid cell side.

*Corners are legal locations:*:: If snapping is enabled, then an additional snap point is created at the corner of each grid cell.

*Show grid:*:: If checked, then the grid will be drawn over the Board image using the specified color.

*Draw center dots:*:: If checked, dots are drawn at the center of each cell using the specified color.

*Color:*:: Color used to draw the grid and center dots.

*Edit Grid:*:: Clicking the Edit Grid button brings up a graphical interface for positioning and sizing the grid over top of the Map.
