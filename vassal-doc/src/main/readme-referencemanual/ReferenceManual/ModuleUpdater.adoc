For very large VASSAL modules, the Module Updater is a tool to build compact downloads for automatically updating a module from an older version to a newer version.
The player places the updater file in the same folder as the old module file.
Double-clicking on the updater file will replace the old module file with the new version.

Updaters can be used in the same way to update module extensions.

In the years since VASSAL was first released, the amounts of disk space consumed by even a relatively large Module have become less and less significant for the average user.
For most web-related purposes it is therefore recommended to simply upload a brand new version of the module file.
However the feature remains supported for situations where it may come in handy -- e.g.
if module files perhaps needed to be emailed.
