=== Marker
A Marker trait is used to mark a game piece permanently as always having a particular <<Properties.adoc#top,Property.>> Unlike many other types of Properties that can be configured on and by pieces (e.g.
<<DynamicProperty.adoc#top,Dynamic Properties>>), a Marker's value cannot change during play.
In other words, it is like a _constant_ rather than a _variable_ in programming.

Setting a property does not in itself give a game piece any particular behavior.
The property must be recognized by some other trait or class in the module.
Markers can be referenced in <<Map.adoc#GlobalKeyCommand,Global Key Command>> traits and <<Map.adoc#GamePieceLayers,Game Piece Layer>> traits and in many other traits within <<Expression.adoc#top,Expressions>> and <<MessageFormat.adoc#top,Message Formats>>.

*Property name:*::  The name of the property.
This is how the property can be referenced in <<Expression.adoc#top,Expressions>> and <<MessageFormat.adoc#top,Message Formats>>.

*Property value:*::  The value of the property.
This value will remain constant for this piece throughout play, but other pieces could have a Marker of the same name but with a different value.
+
Example: some pieces could have a Marker named _Type_ whose value is _Infantry_ while other pieces have a Marker also named _Type_ but whose value is _Cavalry_.
Pieces could also have an ArmorClass Marker with a numeric value.
By using these Marker in expressions, e.g.
__{ (Type == "Infantry") && (ArmorClass < 5) }>__various decisions about pieces could be made by traits.

You can combine multiple name/value pairs by separating the names and values with a comma (','). To use a literal comma in a name or value, precede it with a backslash ('\').

*EXAMPLE:*  A Marker with property name "owner" and property value "sigmund" would return "sigmund" from getProperty("owner") or $owner$. Use commas to set multiple properties with a single Marker.
A Marker with name "owner,status" and value "sigmund,unknown" would also return "unknown" from getProperty("status") or $status$.
