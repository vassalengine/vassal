=== Menu Separator

This trait allows you to introduce a menu separator (horizontal bar) into a game piece's right-click context menu.
A keystroke need not be provided if the separator does not need the ability to be hidden.
You can add as many menu separators to a piece as you need: place them between the traits whose right-click context menu items you want to be separated.

*Separator description:* Optional description of separator to appear in the Piece Definer window - no other effect.

*If this Key Command is hidden, hide separator:* If the specified Key Command is hidden (by a <<RestrictCommands.adoc#top,Restrict Commands>> trait), then this separator will be hidden also.
This allows you to hide menu separators as desired when there are fewer options currently available in your context menu.
The keystroke can be shared with another trait, or you can provide a unique one.
<<NamedKeyCommands.adoc#top,Named Commands>> can also be used so as not to waste traditional keystrokes.
