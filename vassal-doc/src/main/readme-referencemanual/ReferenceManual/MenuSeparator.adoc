=== Menu Separator

This trait allows you to introduce a menu separator (horizontal bar) into a game piece's right-click context menu.
A keystroke need not be provided if the separator does not need the ability to be hidden.
You can add as many menu separators to a piece as you need: place them between the traits whose right-click context menu items you want to be separated.

*Description:*:: A short description of this trait for your own reference.


*If this Key Command is hidden, hide separator:*:: If the specified Key Command is hidden (by a <<RestrictCommands.adoc#top,Restrict Commands>> trait), then this separator will be hidden also.
+
This allows you to hide menu separators as desired when there are fewer options currently available in your context menu.
+
The keystroke can be shared with another trait, or you can provide a unique one.
<<NamedKeyCommand.adoc#top,Named Commands>> can also be used so as not to waste traditional keystrokes.
