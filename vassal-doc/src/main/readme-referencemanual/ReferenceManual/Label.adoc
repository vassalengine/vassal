=== Text Label

This trait displays a text label on or near the piece.
The text of the label can be fixed or specifiable by a player at game time.

*Description:*  A description of the purpose of this label that is displayed in the Piece Definer.

*Text:*  The starting value for the label text. The string entered in the *Text* field is evaluated as follows:

. Check if the entered label is a Beanshell expression, then evaluate it as such.
. Check if the entered label can be interpreted as is an integer. This is the case if the label only contains digits.	
. Check if the entered label is a $$ Variable Substitution (defined by a string enclosed between $ characters). This allows <<Properties.adoc#top,Properties>> of the piece to be substituted with $..$ notation, as in a <<MessageFormat.adoc#top,Message Format>>
. If no check is true the entered string is displayed.

A known limitation of the evaluation order above is that if you enter a sequence of digits starting with 0s, these will be removed when the string is evaluated as integer.
A workaround to this is to enter the same string via a Beanshell expression. For example to display a sequence of 3 zeroes as label text you can use *{"000"}*.
Note that the Beanshell expressions should be preferred to $$ Variable Substitutions. The latter are only available for historical reasons.

By enclosing the text within tags, you can use simple HTML format to specify various colors, fonts and sizes.

Example: 
****
_<html><b>Bold text</b><p>with a line break<p>and <font color=red>different</font> <font color=blue>colors</font></html>_ will display as:

*Bold text* +
with a line break +
and [red]#different# [blue]#colors#
****
